    "<p><strong>Paradox</strong> is a 2D temporal puzzle game I developed, inspired by the time-inversion mechanics from the film <em>Tenet</em>.</p>",
    "<p>The core gameplay loop allows the player to <strong>invert</strong> their personal flow of time. This causes them to move backward through the world, observing their own past actions in reverse. By <strong>re-verting</strong> to forward time, the player creates a new \"self\" on the timeline, allowing them to cooperate with their own past selves to solve complex puzzles.</p>",
    "<p>The game also features inverted physics objects. For example, an \"inverted bomb\" doesn't explode; it implodes, sucking in energy and freezing its surroundings, as its entropy is reversed relative to the world.</p>",
    "<h3>Technical Implementation</h3>",
    "<ul>",
    "<li><strong>Engine:</strong> Developed in <strong>Unity (C#)</strong>.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Core Mechanic:</strong> The entire <em>Tenet</em>-style time system is powered by a <strong>complex, custom data structure</strong> I designed from scratch. This structure manages multiple, simultaneous timelines for each \"self\" (past, inverted, and present) and allows for the data to be read both forwards and backwards seamlessly.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> I integrated an <strong>ad mediation platform</strong> to manage and optimize ad revenue by having multiple providers bid for ad spots. I also implemented an <strong>In-App Purchase (IAP)</strong> system for an \"Ad-Free\" option.</li>",
    "<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Published and available on both the <strong>iOS App Store</strong> and <strong>Google Play Store</strong>.</li>",

      "description": "To allow you to invert, the game constantly records 'Moments' of your Position, Direction, and IsMoving status (15 times a second). This data acts like a 'footprint' in time. I smooth this data out so when you watch your past selves, their movement is fluid, not jerky."

      "description": "This shows how you exist on the timeline. Top Row (Green): This is your original path, moving forward in time. Middle Row (Red): You've 'inverted.' You are now moving backward from Moment 4 to Moment 2, watching your original self's actions happen in reverse. Bottom Row (Green): You 're-vert' at Moment 2. You're moving forward again, but now you can co-exist with your other selves."

      "caption": "How All Your 'Selves' Appear at Once",
      "description": "This is the magic that lets you see multiple 'yous.' The dictionary groups all your selves by the 'Moment' they are in. For example, at 'Moment 3,' the game looks up that key and finds: Your original 'past-past self' (top row), Your 'inverted self' (middle row), and Your current self (bottom row). It then displays all three on-screen, all moving in their respective directions."
